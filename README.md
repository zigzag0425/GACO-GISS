# GACO-GISS
This is an algorithm for solving TTP.
First, configure the relevant paths and parameters. Then, initiate ICA to acquire items with potentially high returns. Following that, launch ACO to generate the routeï¼Œ then use 2-opt to optimize the route. Lastly, activate GISS to produce item selection plans.
